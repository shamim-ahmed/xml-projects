xml-projects
============
This repository contains two projects that I completed as part of XML Technologies course. 

1. The project 'forecast' demonstrates how to use XSLT to solve real-world problems.
2. The project 'clinical-reports' demonstrates how to process a large number of XML files using DOM API, 
   extract relevant content and generate HTML pages using the extracted info.
